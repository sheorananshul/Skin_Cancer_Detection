Project Title: Skin Lesion Classification
Dataset Overview
This project utilizes the HAM10000 dataset, a collection of skin lesion images. The dataset contains 10,000 images labeled with the diagnosis (dx) for each skin lesion. The images in the dataset come from multiple categories, each representing a different type of skin condition. The images are in .jpg format and vary in size, with some being resized for visualization.
