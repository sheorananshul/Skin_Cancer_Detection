# Skin Lesion Classification

## Dataset Overview
For this study, the open-source **Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM 10000 (Human Against Machine)** dataset will be used. It contains 10,000 dermoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions, with seven types of skin lesions namely: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), actinic keratoses (AKIEC), benign keratosis (BKL), skin fibroma (DF), melanocytic nevus (NV), melanomas (MEL), and vascular skin lesion (VASC). All the images are in `.jpg` format, typically in colour (RGB), which represents the visual appearance of the skin lesions.

## Steps Taken So Far

1. **Dataset Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset's metadata file (`HAM10000_metadata.csv`) is used to load information about each image.
   - The image paths are mapped from the metadata, allowing us to locate each image in the file system.
   - Each image is read using the `PIL` library and stored in the `skin_df` DataFrame.

2. **Image Visualization**:
   - Sampled **5 images** from each category (`dx`) and display them in a grid.
   - Images are displayed at their original resolution without resizing to maintain their quality.
   - **Matplotlib** is used to create subplots and visualize the sampled images, and we save the final plot at **DPI 500** to ensure high-quality output.

     
3. **Data Cleaning**
   - **Handling Missing Age Values**: The dataset has missing values for the `'age'` feature. These missing values are filled with the mean age of all patients to maintain consistency and avoid dropping rows with missing data.

   
5. **Data Visualization**
This section visualizes key features of the **HAM10000** dataset to understand the distribution of skin lesions:

- **Skin Lesion Types (`'dx'`)**: A bar plot showing the distribution of different lesion types like BCC, AKIEC, BKL, etc.
- **Lesion Localization (`'localization'`)**: A bar plot showing where skin lesions are most commonly located on the body.
- **Sex Distribution (`'sex'`)**: A bar plot showing the gender distribution of patients with skin lesions.
- **Age Distribution (`'age'`)**: A histogram visualizing the age range of patients affected by skin lesions.

These visualizations help to better understand the datasetâ€™s structure and guide further analysis


 6. **Model Training**  
This section describes the deep learning models used for skin lesion classification:  

- **ResNet50**: A deep neural network with 50 layers and residual connections that improve accuracy and prevent the vanishing gradient problem, making deep models more trainable.  
- **InceptionV3**: A deep learning model that uses multiple kernel sizes in a single layer to capture diverse spatial features, enhancing classification performance.  
- **DenseNet121**: A densely connected convolutional network with 121 layers, where each layer is connected to every other layer, improving feature reuse, gradient flow, and model efficiency.  

### Model Training Workflow

- **Data Split**: The dataset is split into training and test sets with an 80-20 ratio using `train_test_split`.
- **Training the Models**: The models are trained using the `fit` method, with early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting.

7. **BERT model**
In the upcoming weeks, we will extend the current model by extracting features using BERT for the dx_type and localization columns of the HAM10000 dataset. These features will be used to combine with other baseline model features for improved classification.
